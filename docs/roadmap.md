# Roadmap / Future Features

Features and improvements planned for future versions.

## API Improvements

- [ ] Multi-schema conversion function (`convertMultipleSchemas()`)
  - Convert all exported schemas from a single file in one call
  - Automatically merge and deduplicate imports across conversions
  - Automatically extract and deduplicate enum classes by signature
  - Return single combined output with proper formatting
  - Handle errors per-schema (continue with others if one fails)
  - Support both Pydantic and TypeScript targets
  - **Use case:** Programmatic API users who want to convert multiple schemas from one file and get merged output (currently requires manual work)
