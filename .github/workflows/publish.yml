        # IMPORTANT: This uses npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
        # For this to work, you MUST:
        # 1. Create the package on npmjs.com first.
        # 2. In your npm package settings, under "Trusted Publishers", add this repository.
        # This will grant the workflow permission to publish new versions.
        # The E404 error you saw likely means the package doesn't exist or isn't configured for trusted publishing.
        # --ignore-scripts is used because we've already built everything in the build job.
