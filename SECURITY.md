Security fixes will be applied to the latest released version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in SchemaBridge:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Instead, please contact the maintainer privately:

3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Version of SchemaBridge
   - How you discovered the issue
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Any potential impact you see

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible.
- Investigate and validate the issue.
- Work on a fix and coordinate a release.
- Credit you in release notes if you’d like (or keep you anonymous if you prefer).

## Public Disclosure

Please give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and fix the issue before any public disclosure.  
We’ll coordinate with you on timing once we understand the impact and a fix is ready.
